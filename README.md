# Alma Analytics E-Book Usage Dashboard

This project describes a dashboard that was created in Alma Analytics to visualize e-book usage patterns over time and across platforms from COUNTER data imported into Alma via manual upload and SUSHI harvesting. It describes some of the customizations that were made and provides sample SQL code that other institutions can adapt. If you have questions or comments, contact Summer Durrant at <sdurrant@umw.edu>.
